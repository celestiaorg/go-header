# Welcome

Welcome to the go-header specifications.

go-header is a library for syncing blockchain data, such as block headers, over the P2P network in a trust-minimized way. It contains services for requesting and receiving headers from the P2P network, serving header requests from other nodes in the P2P network, storing headers, and syncing historical headers in case of fallbacks.

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|[Subscriber](specs/p2p.md#subscriber)|listens for new headers from the P2P network|
|[ExchangeServer](specs/p2p.md#exchange-server)|serve header requests from other nodes in the P2P network|
|[Exchange](specs/p2p.md#exchange-client)|client that requests headers from other nodes in the P2P network|
|[Store](specs/store.md)|storing headers and making them available for access by other services such as exchange and syncer|
|[Syncer](specs/sync.md)|syncing of historical and new headers from the P2P network|

The go-header library defines a clear interface (as described in the table below) for consumption. Any blockchain data implementing this interface can utilize go-header's P2P services. An example is defined in [headertest/dummy_header.go][dummy header]

|Method|Input|Output|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
| New | | H | New creates new instance of a header. |
| IsZero | | bool | IsZero reports whether Header is a zero value of it's concrete type. |
| ChainID | | string | ChainID returns identifier of the chain. |
| Hash | | Hash | Hash returns hash of a header. |
| Height | | uint64 | Height returns the height of a header. |
| LastHeader | | Hash | LastHeader returns the hash of last header before this header (aka. previous header hash). |
| Time | | time.Time | Time returns time when header was created. |
| Verify | H | error | Verify validates given untrusted Header against trusted Header. |
| Validate | | error | Validate performs stateless validation to check for missed/incorrect fields. |
| MarshalBinary | | []byte, error| MarshalBinary encodes the receiver into a binary form and returns the result. |
| UnmarshalBinary | []byte | error | UnmarshalBinary must be able to decode the form generated by MarshalBinary. UnmarshalBinary must copy the data if it wishes to retain the data after returning.|
